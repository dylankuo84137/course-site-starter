I would like to share with you my attempts and insights from the "Nenggao Mountain" course. This was not just an adjustment to the curriculum, but a journey where the children and I truly "grounded" ourselves together.

#### **1\. Why did I make this change? Returning from "Classics" to "The Land Beneath Our Feet"**

To be honest, I struggled at the beginning of my preparation. For the last nature study block, I taught the classic *The Wonderful Adventures of Nils*. It’s a great story with beautiful text. But this time, a voice inside me asked, "These scenes are so far away. Shouldn't we let the children hear stories from our own land?"

So, I boldly set aside the foreign classics and chose an old local picture book, *Nenggao Mountain*. Because the book was short, it actually gave me a lot of space to "fill in the blanks." I started reading extensively about Bunun mythology, researching why the Formosan black bear has a white V on its chest, and learning stories about the hundred-pacer snake.

I discovered that when I infused these local elements—and even my own real feelings about typhoons and mountains from my hiking trips—into the narrative, the story gained a soul. It was no longer just text in a book.

#### **2\. Flipping Literacy: Turning "Wanting to Say" into "Wanting to Write"**

We often worry that children aren't writing enough characters or that their workbooks aren't perfect. But this time, I tried to let go. I stopped insisting on writing in the workbook every day. I found that when children are moved by a story, they have a strong desire to express themselves.

While arranging the drama, I encouraged the children to engage in **"Free Writing."** The line in the play, *"Nabu's body turned into Nenggao Mountain,"* was actually written by a child using phonetic symbols (Zhuyin) and simple Chinese characters.

When they realized the sentences they wrote had become lines in the play, the look of achievement in their eyes was undeniable. I truly feel that rather than making them copy mechanically, letting them use text to capture the images in their minds—that is what literacy is supposed to be.

#### **3\. Adjusting the Drama Form: Regaining the Children's Sense of Safety**

For this play, I went back to the **"Circular Formation"** I used nine years ago when directing *France*.

For lower-grade children, the pressure of a proscenium stage facing an audience directly is too great. In a circle, we are within a group, telling a story together. That fear disappeared and was replaced by a sense of ease.

Interestingly, due to venue issues, our rehearsal time was unexpectedly extended. I was anxious at first, but then I decided to use this time to let the plot happen "repetitively." I discovered that this repetition became a steady rhythm, deepening the children's physical memory of the story. They even started designing their own movements and choosing their own roles. This taught me that sometimes, "getting stuck" in teaching is actually a gift from the heavens.

#### **4\. Sincere Words to Partners: The Teacher's "Image" and "Stance"**

My deepest realization from this course is this: **The teacher's internal "image and stance" are more important than any perfect lesson plan.**

In recent years, I started hiking and challenging myself outdoors. These physical experiences gave me a completely different perspective on the story of *Nenggao Mountain*.

I feel that even as experienced teachers, we must be brave enough to **"Zero Out" (Reset)** ourselves. Don't rely too much on past archives. Try to walk the scene yourself, read books you haven't read before. When we are full of curiosity and passion for the content we teach, the children will receive that vitality.

The road ahead is still long, and I am still exploring. Next, I hope to refine the children's writing skills, allowing this energy of free expression to grow into a more solid structure.
