**Introduction: Drama is More Than Just a Performance**

In the third-grade curriculum at our Waldorf school, parents often ask, "Why are there so many drama classes?" This question is also the core proposition I ask myself every time I lead children toward the stage. To me, drama has never been just an artistic performance; it is an unfinished painting, a profound journey that allows children to integrate their inner experiences with outward expression. This year, with this group of nine-year-olds, we chose the ancient indigenous "Legend of Shooting the Sun" and decided to challenge ourselves by singing this adventure of seeking light in the language of our land—Taiwanese (Hokkien).

**Motivation: Why Choose the Hard Path?**

Initially, my partner, Teacher Yun-hsuan, and I were filled with question marks: "Should we really try performing in Taiwanese?" For modern children, Taiwanese is not their daily language, making this undeniably a high mountain to climb. We could have easily chosen Mandarin, which would have made the rehearsal process smoother and safer.

However, when I saw the light in the children's eyes as they playfully used broken Taiwanese during breaks or hummed local folk songs, I realized this was an educational opportunity. By weaving "singing" and "acting" together, language ceased to be a dry subject and became a key to entering a character. We decided not to be bound by a fixed script or pursue perfect memorization, but to reserve enough space for this ancient story of courage, heritage, and sacrifice to flow naturally into the children's lives.

**Innovation & Challenges: Casting for the Soul**

In this dramatic journey, I made a decision that differed entirely from traditional casting: **Roles were assigned not based on "who acts the best," but on "who needs the nourishment of this role the most."**

This class has many only children who are used to expressing themselves but often overlook others. If I only let the talented kids play the leads, the drama would lose its educational depth. Therefore, I viewed this casting as assigning a "life mission" to each child:

* **For the high-energy child:** I had those who usually couldn't sit still play the "Suns." They needed to run and tumble on stage, which guided them to channel their excess energy into dramatic tension and learn to connect with the group amidst their wildness.  
* **For the internally chaotic child:** For a child whose internal rhythm was often in disarray, I asked him to be the "Rhythm Keeper." Every beat of his drum determined the flow of the entire play. This responsibility helped him move from chaos toward order.  
* **For the daydreaming child:** A child whose mind often wandered was assigned to operate the lighting. She couldn't see the stage and had to rely on "listening" to judge the timing. This invisible yet critical task miraculously awakened her focus.  
* **For the academically gifted child:** For those accustomed to applause, I deliberately reduced their lines and invited them to step back. This was not a punishment, but an invitation to learn humility and practice "seeing" the light in others.

**Student Observations: From Applause to Truly Seeing**

This path was not easy. During rehearsals, we experienced arguments, forgotten lines, and frustrations. But what moved me the most was not the beautiful lighting on the day of the performance, but the strength the children grew throughout the process.

I remember one extremely withdrawn child who was assigned to stand alone under the spotlight. This was incredibly difficult for him. But on the day of the show, when he stood there, trembling but firm, I saw a different kind of light in his eyes. After the performance, instead of a flashy celebration, we exchanged "verbal gifts." The children no longer just said "You were great"; they looked into each other's eyes and said, "I saw that you changed from speaking hurriedly to speaking slowly," or "Your steps became steady."

The parents also became partners in this education. They learned to give specific feedback on the children's transformation rather than empty praise. This genuine "seeing" nourishes a child's confidence more than any applause ever could.

**Reflection and Conclusion**

This experience with "The Legend of Shooting the Sun" made me deeply realize: When teachers are willing to let go of the anxiety for a "perfect result," the beauty of education flows out naturally. Drama is both the "Education of Art" and the "Art of Education."

**Please believe that the "process" itself has healing power. Only when we stop obsessing over whether children are perfect on stage can we see the true strength sprouting within their souls.**
