# AI Application Techniques for the Cixin Course Weaver: A Teacher's Guide

## 1. What is an "AI-Friendly Website"? How does it help teachers?

This website is not just a platform for displaying course materials, but a "structured database" designed for AI.

Simply put, we have organized **detailed data of all courses** on the website—from course introductions and syllabi to the **complete text content** of every worksheet, script, and story draft—into a full corpus file named `llms-full.txt`.

**What are the benefits for teachers?**

Simply share this corpus URL with Large Language Models (such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.), turning AI into a teaching assistant that best understands the "CiXin Curriculum Map". You can:

*   **Quickly Query and Integrate:** Search for specific subject materials across courses and grade levels.
*   **Deep Analysis and Comparison:** Analyze teaching methods and content differences between different courses.
*   **Efficiently Create Teaching Resources:** Let AI automatically generate new worksheets, activity plans, scripts, etc., based on existing materials.

## 2. What data can AI read from the website?

Once you share the `llms-full.txt` URL with the AI, it can immediately grasp the following information:

| Data Type | Content Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Course Basic Data** | Course name, grade, semester, field, instructor |
| **Course Details** | Course introduction, teaching objectives, teacher introduction |
| **Full Text of Materials** | **Full text of all PDFs and Google Docs**, for example:<br> - Worksheet<br> - Syllabus<br> - Play Script<br> - Story |
| **Full Material List** | **Names** and **tags** of workbooks, photos, chalkboard drawings, sheet music, etc. |
| **Multimedia File Info** | Links and descriptions of song audio files and videos |

**Key Advantage:** AI no longer guesses, but can **directly read and understand** the **content** of every PDF material in the corpus, making its output much closer to your actual teaching needs.

## 3. How to start? Two main methods

You can choose one of the following two methods to let AI read the website data according to your needs.

### Method 1: Share the Full Corpus URL (Recommended for most complete information)

This method allows AI to obtain the most complete data, including the full text of all course PDFs, resulting in the most accurate analysis.

**Step 1: Copy the corpus URL**

1.  Copy the following link:
    *   <a href="{{ site.url }}/en-US/llms-full.txt" target="_blank">{{ site.url }}/en-US/llms-full.txt</a>

**Step 2: Share the URL with your AI tool**

1.  Open your preferred AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
2.  Paste the URL directly into the chat box — the AI will fetch and read the full corpus.

**Step 3: Start asking!**

After the AI reads the corpus, you can start giving instructions. It is recommended to first use a sentence to let the AI understand the content:

> "This is my school's course database, containing introductions for all courses, material lists, and the full text of PDF materials. Please answer my subsequent questions based on this content."

### Method 2: Use Google NotebookLM (Most convenient, suitable for quick analysis)

If you don't want to download files, Google's NotebookLM tool can directly read public data on the website, which is very convenient.

**Step 1: Enter NotebookLM and Add Source**

1.  Go to the <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/" target="_blank">Google NotebookLM</a> website.
2.  Create a new Notebook.
3.  In the "Sources" section on the left, click "Add new source" and select "Website".

**Step 2: Paste the URL**

In the popup window, paste the URL you want to analyze. You can choose:
*   **Analyze the entire website:** Paste the homepage URL `{{ site.url }}/`
*   **Analyze a specific course:** Paste the URL of a single course, e.g., `{{ site.url }}/courses/2a-nenggao-113-summer/`

NotebookLM will automatically crawl the web page content as a data source.

**Step 3: Start asking!**

After the data source is processed, you can start asking questions in the chat box below. Since NotebookLM already knows the data source, you can ask directly:

> "Based on the source, summarize the teaching objectives of this course."
> "Design three extension discussion questions for this course."
> "Find all scripts or stories used in this course and list their titles."

## 4. Prompt Examples: From Inquiry to Creation

You can copy or modify the following examples to explore the powerful features of AI.

【Role Setting Prompt】
